# Get Some New Tab — Chrome Extension

A minimal new tab with motivational words chosen by yourself and changeable background/text color.

You can also watch a video about the idea behind and the use of the [Get Some New Tab Extension on YouTube](https://youtu.be/rUMYaon-8ZA).

## Motivation

I had been using [Momentum](https://momentumdash.com/) for a few years but noticed that the design is not minmal enough for my taste and (more importantly) the photos are inspirational on one day and on others I feel like I am trapped in my own apartment and can't really get to those places any time soon… so it's pulling me down emotionally.

That's why I created "Get Some New Tab" which simply focuses on two text areas which you can choose to display whatever text you enter. I even use it with a super muted color scheme so that it does not draw much attention at all.

## Usage & Options

For now, the extension is not available in the Chrome Extension store (this may change in the future). You can however, download it and then add it to your own Chromium based browser manually.

In terms of options:

### Change Colors

Simply double click on the backgorund and the options screen will open which gives you the options to change the background or text color with a color picker. These changes are previewed and presistent immediately.

On this options screen you also have the option to reset everything to the default values which are set when you install the extension.

### Change the Textfields

To change the text which is displayed in the center, you simply double click the text line you'd like to change and enter a new text. Please note that both fields must have text in them and there is no support to enter multiple lines of text. The purpose is to be minimal.
